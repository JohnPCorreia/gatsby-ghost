Depending on the type of equity issued, the security may include a claim on part of the business’s assets and earnings or even voting rights.  Offering equity is a great way to raise money quickly without needing to pay that money back.  However, be sure you’re comfortable relinquishing some control and ownership of your business.",

Debt securities are attractive to businesses who want to retain full control of the company and believe they’ll be able to not only repay their loans, but on time.",

Businesses pay back a percent of net revenue each month until the loan is paid in full.  When the business is doing well, a funder may receive larger payments up front; when the business is slow, payments will be lower and may take a longer time to be paid (especially if there is no stated repayment date).  Offering revenue shares allow you to retain full control of your company and are favorable to businesses who can't support a fixed payment schedule.",

The difference is that the loan accrues interest which may either be paid out at end of the loan or converted into equity based on a predetermined discount rate. A convertible note typically pays out at a reduced interest rate due to the potential upside of converting to equity. In the event that the note is “converted,” the amount of equity you receive will depend on the specific terms of the note.  Convertible notes are common if seeking immediate capital, flexible financing options and lower interest rates. Keep in mind that if the note converts to equity, businesses are responsible for investor reporting.",
